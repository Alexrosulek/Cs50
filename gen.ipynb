            "Escape to the lake with your doggo by your side at Lake Ahquabi State Park! This secluded getaway is the perfect place to recharge -- is a Native American word meaning \"resting place\". The body of water is actually man-made, but that doesn't make it any less beautiful or fun to enjoy.\n",
            "At the campground, you'll find 105 campsites to pick from, 75 of which offer electric hookup options and one that is set up just to accommodate organized youth groups. Each lot has its own picnic table and fire ring to make your stay more comfortable. Drinking water is provided on-site and you can purchase ice and firewood without having to leave the park. Nightly fees between $6 and $16 apply depending on the time of year you visit and the hookup options you require.\n",
            "A lot of the fun at Lake Ahquabi is found at the water, where you can jump in for a swim or paddle around on a canoe, kayak, or paddleboard (all which can be rented in the park). For those that visit in the middle of the summer, a special treat awaits. The skies will fill with giant, brightly-colored hot air balloons, which will no doubt delight your family -- and probably confuse your sweet pooch. You may also catch a wedding during your stay, as the lovely stone lodge makes for a sought-after venue for larger events.\n",
            "Four-legged patrons are welcome at the park as long as they stay on a standard leash throughout their visit. As always, be a good pup parent by cleaning up your doggo's bathroom breaks and never leaving your canine compadre unattended. That shouldn't be too hard to do, as the two of you can spend ample time hitting the 6.5 miles of trail that wraps around the lake.\n",
            "To truly unwind, check out Lake Ahquabi State Park for your next camping adventure!\n",

This popular park combines a dedicated dog park with a wide array of recreational opportunities, making it a versatile choice for a memorable visit.\\n\\nDog Park Highlights\\n\\nThe park’s 105 campsites include 75 with electric hookups, providing a comfortable base for your stay. The dog park is a key feature, designed to foster socialization and exercise for your furry friend. An annual membership fee of $25 per dog is required, and vaccination records (Parvo/Distemper and Rabies) are mandatory. A magnetic access card is provided for entry. Due to it being a new park, consider a slow socialization approach initially. Toys are permitted, but sharing is discouraged if your dog is guarding them. The park operates under strict rules enforced by police, animal control, and city code enforcers. Aggression must be immediately addressed, and dogs will be removed from the area if aggressive behavior is detected. Understand that dog play can be rough – expect chasing, nipping, wrestling, and barking. Observe interactions carefully and intervene if your dog shows signs of distress. The City of Indianola is responsible for any injuries that may occur.\\n\\nBeyond the Dog Park: A Park for Everyone\\n\\nLake Ahquabi offers significantly more than just the dog park. The man-made lake provides ample opportunities for water activities. Swimming, canoeing, kayaking, and paddleboarding are popular choices. Rentals are available on-site. During the summer, don’t miss the spectacular hot air balloon festival, a delightful experience for the whole family (though perhaps a bit confusing for your dog!). Weddings are frequently held at the park’s beautiful stone lodge, making it a sought-after venue.\\n\\nHiking and Biking Trails\\n\\nExplore the park’s 6.5 miles of trails that wrap around the lake, perfect for walking, hiking, or biking. These trails offer scenic views and a chance to connect with nature.\\n\\nCamping and Amenities\\n\\nWith 105 campsites, including 75 with electric hookups, camping at Lake Ahquabi is a comfortable experience. Each lot is equipped with a picnic table and fire ring. Drinking water is readily available, and you can purchase ice and firewood on-site. Nightly fees range from $6 to $16, depending on the time of year and hookup options.\\n\\nNearby Attractions\\n\\nWhile Lake Ahquabi State Park offers plenty to do, you can easily expand your exploration. Consider visiting similar state parks like Palisades-Kepler State Park, Viking Lake State Park, Lake Wapello State Park, Black Hawk State Park, and Pikes Peak State Park.\\n\\nImportant Reminders\\n\\nAlways be a responsible pet parent. Clean up after your dog, and never leave your canine companion unattended. \\n\\nContact Information\\n\\nLake Ahquabi State Park\\nIndianola, IA 50125', 'faq': '### Lake Ahquabi State Park FAQ\\n\\n**General Information**\\n\\nQ: What is Lake Ahquabi State Park?\\nA: Lake Ahquabi State Park is a popular state park located in Indianola, Iowa, offering a variety of recreational opportunities including a dog park, camping, fishing, hiking, biking, and water activities.\\n\\nQ: Where is Lake Ahquabi State Park located?\\nA: The park is situated in Indianola, Iowa, with the zip code 50125.\\n\\nQ: What are the park’s hours of operation?\\nA: The park is open year-round, with specific concession services available during Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend from 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM daily.\\n\\nQ: How much does it cost to visit Lake Ahquabi State Park?\\nA: There is a per-night camping fee ranging from $6 to $16, depending on the time of year and the hookup options selected.

            "It is important for dogs to have off leash exercise to sniff and run. But the free and open nature of public dog parks has drawbacks. There could be aggressive dogs, disease transmission and cleanliness issues. For this reason, many dog behaviorists discourage visiting public dog parks and recommend Sniffspot's private dog parks. Sniffspot private dog parks only allow one guest to book at a time and are not open to the public, which solves many of these issues.\n",
            "While public dog parks have a number of safety issues, such as aggressive dogs, disease transmission and general cleanliness, Sniffspot dog parks much safer than public dog parks. With Sniffspot all bookings are private for just you and dogs you bring with you and we require all dogs to be vaccinated (or have equivalent titers). All Sniffspot locations are vetted and reviewed by guests so you can find the perfect place for you and your dog.\n",

If your dog is reactive to other dogs, you can visit one of our 103 off leash areas where there are no dogs audible or visible nearby. You can also filter locations to avoid other domestic animals and people. We also recommend reading reviews and reaching out to the host with any questions.\n",
