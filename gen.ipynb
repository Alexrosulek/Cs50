There was initial debate about the amount of coastal access offered by the developers, leading to advocacy for additional public parkland.

The logo for Sea Ranch was designed by Barbara Stauffacher Solomon.\\n\\n**Q: What are the demographics of the area around the dog park?**\\n\\nA: According to the 2010 United States Census, The Sea Ranch had a population of 1,305.

Established with a focus on harmonizing with the natural surroundings, the park’s origins stem from the broader vision of the Sea Ranch development, spearheaded by Charles and Joan Turnbull, and later managed by Marion Conrad. Initially, the developer offered 140 acres for public parkland, but community advocates pushed for additional coastal access. This led to the creation of the dog park as part of the larger Sea Ranch Public Access Trails system. The park’s design, influenced by Barbara Stauffacher Solomon’s Supergraphics, incorporates elements like baffles on exterior lighting to minimize light pollution and a lack of roof overhangs to allow prevailing breezes to flow freely, all contributing to a seamless integration within the Sea Ranch landscape. The Dog Park is a valued resource utilized by both local dog owners and visitors seeking a natural and engaging outdoor experience.'}, 'client_id': 'client001'}\n",

Melvin Price Memorial Park, located at 1500 Caseyville Ave in Swansea, IL, is a great spot for dog owners looking to enjoy some outdoor time with their furry friends. This dog-friendly park features separate areas for big and small dogs, ensuring a safer play environment. It is fully fenced and equipped with a double-gated entrance, making it easy for your pup to explore without worry. With free parking nearby, seating areas, and shaded spots, you can relax while your dog plays. Please note that all dogs must remain on-leash, ensuring a comfortable and controlled atmosphere for everyone. While the small dog area may be limited in size and lacks shaded spaces, the large dog area offers more room for playful pups. Amenities like a water fountain, poop bags, and a hose are available on-site, making clean-up and hydration easy. However, there are no off-leash areas, swimming options, or camping facilities, so keep that in mind when planning your visit. Laboring under somewhat mixed reviews, users suggest that while the large dog area is decent, the small dog space could use some improvements. Melvin Price Memorial Park is not just a place for dog play; it also holds historical significance in the community. Named after a notable local figure, the park honors the legacy of Melvin Price, a former U.S. Congressman who contributed to the region's development. With beautiful walking trails and the potential for observing local wildlife, this park offers a serene escape for both dogs and their owners. \n",

            "Oscar Scherer State Park in Osprey, Florida, offers a unique blend of natural beauty and historical significance, making it a popular destination for birdwatchers, outdoor enthusiasts, and those interested in Florida’s past. The park’s origins trace back to the early 20th century when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers initiated a project to construct a coquina fort – known as Torre de Matanzas – at Matanzas Inlet. This fort was strategically designed to protect the burgeoning settlement of Osprey and provide a vantage point for monitoring shipping activity. Construction began in 1742 and was completed in 1742 under orders from Governor Manuel de Montiano. The fort, utilizing coquina stone and pine pilings, was engineered by Pedro Ruiz de Olano, who had previously worked on the Castillo de San Marcos at St. Augustine. Five cannons were strategically placed at the fort – four six-pounders and one eighteen-pounder – capable of targeting the inlet which at the time was less than half a mile away. In 1742, the fort successfully deterred a British scouting party led by James Oglethorpe, demonstrating its immediate defensive capabilities. Following the British evacuation of St. Augustine, the fort’s importance diminished, and it was decommissioned. The site was later acquired by the U.S. Army and eventually transferred to the National Park Service in 1933. The National Monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. The park’s history reflects a commitment to preserving both the natural landscape and this important historical landmark. Today, visitors can explore the remnants of Torre de Matanzas, learn about the fort’s strategic role, and enjoy the park’s diverse ecosystems.\n",

            "**What is a Dog Park?** Dog parks, sometimes referred to as “off-leash” parks, are fenced-in areas where owners may safely allow their dogs to exercise, play, and socialize with other dogs. Lincolnites currently enjoy two dog parks. The first, Rickman’s Run, with 26 acres of beautiful rolling landscape, mature trees, and a natural waterway, is located just southeast of 70th and Holmes Lake roads. Our community’s second dog park, Oak Lake Dog Park, is also a large park (about 20 acres). With ample parking, it is conveniently located at 1st and Cornhusker Hwy, just northwest of downtown, close the University of Nebraska Campus, Memorial Stadium, Pinnacle Arena, and the new Haymarket Park retail district.  | \n",

Today, Friends of the Dog Parks actively works in conjunction with individuals, businesses, and city officials to promote, create, and improve off-leash parks, as well as the off-leash park experience, in Lincoln, Nebraska.**What are the Benefits of Dog Parks?** Off-leash parks not only benefit our canine friends, but our citizens and our community also benefit in numerous ways as well**. Some of these benefits are obvious and immediate, while others may be less so. As you tour our website and visit our dog parks, keep in mind the following list of benefits that nearly everyone enjoys from our Lincoln dog parks!\n",
            "  * Well-exercised dogs are healthy, happy, and make better neighbors.\n",
            "  * Dog parks create a sense of community and forge friendships. \n",
            "  * Dog parks help break the ice between strangers.\n",

            "  * Dog parks benefit apartment dwellers and homeowners with small or unfenced yards.\n",
            "  * Dog parks promote responsible pet ownership and provide alternative means to educate dog owners.\n",
            "  * Dog parks strengthen the bond between owners and their dogs. Bettering that relationship makes it less likely that the pet will experience behavioral issues, which may lead the owner surrendering their dog to a shelter.\n",
            "  * Dogs and dog parks discourage crime and loitering.\n",
            "  * Dog parks raise property values. And, for those near the park, this can be a significant increase.\n",
            "  * Dog parks have become a sought-after amenity among people relocating to the community.\n",
            "  * It’s estimated that there are 1 in 5 households in Lincoln, Nebraska that have a dog as member. That’s over 44,000 dogs!\n",

However, even a few small improvements can go a long way in eliminating potential problem areas and making our dog parks even better places to be! The Lincoln Parks and Recreation department is currently performing a survey to guide dog park improvement as well as the construction of new dog parks in the future. The survey can be . They are interested in your input.Please tell the Parks and Recreation department not only what you like about our dog parks, but also where you think can they use improvement.

It has been prepared to assist you in communicating your own comments and suggestions to the Lincoln Parks and Recreation department.

Some of these benefits are obvious and immediate, while others may be less so. As you tour our website and visit our dog parks, keep in mind the following list of benefits that nearly everyone enjoys from our Lincoln dog parks!\\n  * Well-exercised dogs are healthy, happy, and make better neighbors.\\n  * Dog parks create a sense of community and forge friendships. \\n  * Dog parks help break the ice between strangers.\\n  * Dog parks add open space, beauty, and livability to urban and densely populated areas.\\n  * Dog parks benefit apartment dwellers and homeowners with small or unfenced yards.\\n  * Dog parks promote responsible pet ownership and provide alternative means to educate dog owners.\\n  * Dog parks strengthen the bond between owners and their dogs. Bettering that relationship makes it less likely that the pet will experience behavioral issues, which may lead the owner surrendering their dog to a shelter.\\n  * Dogs and dog parks discourage crime and loitering.\\n  * Dog parks raise property values. And, for those near the park, this can be a significant increase.\\n  * Dog parks have become a sought-after amenity among people relocating to the community.\\n  * It’s estimated that there are 1 in 5 households in Lincoln, Nebraska that have a dog as member. That’s over 44,000 dogs!\\n\\n**While we all benefit from the Lincoln dog parks there is no usage charge.

Tom Reservation) is a standout location. In the heart of the Connecticut River Valley region of Western Massachusetts (MA), or Pioneer Valley, visiting Mt. Tom State Reservation is a must do MA day trip for nature and landscape lovers as well as outdoor/fit lifestyle folks.\\\\nMt. Tom Reservation is renowned for its stunning vistas, so it is definitely worth a visit even if you are not psyched to hike or just want to stop and look out over the vast surrounding landscape.\\\\nNote during our visit, there were at least a couple of signs indicating the park closes at 4pm.\\\\n[**Mt.

Then, take exit 17A to merge onto MA-141 E/Easthampton Rd toward Holyoke and, after almost a half mile, take a left onto Northampton Streetand turn left ontotoReservation Road. \\\\nContinue onto the main entrance at 125 Reservation Rd.\\\\n#### **What to see at Mount Tom State Reservation**\\\\nOnce you drive into the reservation, you can stop and park by Bray Lake for a picnic or easy hiking on the Bray Loop trail, which takes you by the lake. During our visit, we drove up to the Visitor’s Center and parked across from a playground and picnic area. \\\\nTip:If you are visiting for the first time or bringing folks who haven’t been here, use this to pick a trail.\\\\nOne of the main attractions is seeing the stellar Pioneer Valley views by going to the top of Lookout Tower, which you can get to by taking a quick, paved and slightly uphill walk from the Visitor Center. Simply follow the sign behind the visitor center to Bray Tower. This path is suitable for strollers and folks who may have some physical limitations. \\\\nThe lookout tower is three stories of stairs. It’s generally comfortable going up but coming down can seem a bit off-putting at first. You’ll have to let others come down the stairs first because they are not wide and wear your mask. \\\\nTip: There also are a few parking spots right near the Bray lookout tower if needed. \\\\nTip: There are benches by the base of the overlook to stop and take in the view. At many of the vistas, we saw folks with stadium or tailgating chairs. Just pop them out, sit and enjoy the view. \\\\nAfter checking out the view from the tower, there are multiple options for viewing the landscapes by hiking or driving. \\\\nKeep in mind that some trails have noticeable declines/inclines and uneven, cracked pavement, and these are not suitable for strollers or folks that have physical limitations.\\\\nOne way to get amazing views is to drive on Christopher Clark Road by turning left off of Reservation Road at the Visitor Center. There are four spots to safely pull off, and sometimes you’ll have the spot all to yourself.\\\\nAlso, you can head right from the Visitor Center on a paved trail up to Goat Peak where there is an overlook and a (second) Lookout Tower with great views of the town and surrounding landscape. Though the trail distance to Goat Peak is short, it is an uphill hike.\\\\nThere are so many parts of the reservation to explore with different trails and spots to see beautiful vistas, so [check out this trail map](https://www.mass.gov/doc/mt-tom-state-reservation-trail-map/download) to help plan your visit.\\\\nTip: If you like taking Komorebi (i.e., sun flare/light peeking through trees) pictures, Mt.

Tom Reservation) is a standout location. In the heart of the Connecticut River Valley region of Western Massachusetts (MA), or Pioneer Valley, visiting Mt. Tom State Reservation is a must do MA day trip for nature and landscape lovers as well as outdoor/fit lifestyle folks.\\nMt. Tom Reservation is renowned for its stunning vistas, so it is definitely worth a visit even if you are not psyched to hike or just want to stop and look out over the vast surrounding landscape.\\nNote during our visit, there were at least a couple of signs indicating the park closes at 4pm.\\n[**Mt.

Then, take exit 17A to merge onto MA-141 E/Easthampton Rd toward Holyoke and, after almost a half mile, take a left onto Northampton Streetand turn left ontotoReservation Road. \\nContinue onto the main entrance at 125 Reservation Rd.\\n#### **What to see at Mount Tom State Reservation**\\nOnce you drive into the reservation, you can stop and park by Bray Lake for a picnic or easy hiking on the Bray Loop trail, which takes you by the lake. During our visit, we drove up to the Visitor’s Center and parked across from a playground and picnic area. \\nTip:If you are visiting for the first time or bringing folks who haven’t been here, use this to pick a trail.\\nOne of the main attractions is seeing the stellar Pioneer Valley views by going to the top of Lookout Tower, which you can get to by taking a quick, paved and slightly uphill walk from the Visitor Center. Simply follow the sign behind the visitor center to Bray Tower. This path is suitable for strollers and folks who may have some physical limitations. \\nThe lookout tower is three stories of stairs. It’s generally comfortable going up but coming down can seem a bit off-putting at first. You’ll have to let others come down the stairs first because they are not wide and wear your mask. \\nTip: There also are a few parking spots right near the Bray lookout tower if needed. \\nTip: There are benches by the base of the overlook to stop and take in the view. At many of the vistas, we saw folks with stadium or tailgating chairs. Just pop them out, sit and enjoy the view. \\nAfter checking out the view from the tower, there are multiple options for viewing the landscapes by hiking or driving. \\nKeep in mind that some trails have noticeable declines/inclines and uneven, cracked pavement, and these are not suitable for strollers or folks that have physical limitations.\\nOne way to get amazing views is to drive on Christopher Clark Road by turning left off of Reservation Road at the Visitor Center. There are four spots to safely pull off, and sometimes you’ll have the spot all to yourself.\\nAlso, you can head right from the Visitor Center on a paved trail up to Goat Peak where there is an overlook and a (second) Lookout Tower with great views of the town and surrounding landscape. Though the trail distance to Goat Peak is short, it is an uphill hike.\\nThere are so many parts of the reservation to explore with different trails and spots to see beautiful vistas, so [check out this trail map](https://www.mass.gov/doc/mt-tom-state-reservation-trail-map/download) to help plan your visit.\\nTip: If you like taking Komorebi (i.e., sun flare/light peeking through trees) pictures, Mt.

Tom Reservation) is a standout location. In the heart of the Connecticut River Valley region of Western Massachusetts (MA), or Pioneer Valley, visiting Mt. Tom State Reservation is a must do MA day trip for nature and landscape lovers as well as outdoor/fit lifestyle folks.\\nMt. Tom Reservation is renowned for its stunning vistas, so it is definitely worth a visit even if you are not psyched to hike or just want to stop and look out over the vast surrounding landscape.\\nNote during our visit, there were at least a couple of signs indicating the park closes at 4pm.\\n[**Mt.

During our visit, we drove up to the Visitor’s Center and parked across from a playground and picnic area. \\nTip:If you are visiting for the first time or bringing folks who haven’t been here, use this to pick a trail.\\nOne of the main attractions is seeing the stellar Pioneer Valley views by going to the top of Lookout Tower, which you can get to by taking a quick, paved and slightly uphill walk from the Visitor Center. Simply follow the sign behind the visitor center to Bray Tower. This path is suitable for strollers and folks who may have some physical limitations. \\nThe lookout tower is three stories of stairs. It’s generally comfortable going up but coming down can seem a bit off-putting at first. You’ll have to let others come down the stairs first because they are not wide and wear your mask. \\nTip: There also are a few parking spots right near the Bray lookout tower if needed. \\nTip: There are benches by the base of the overlook to stop and take in the view. At many of the vistas, we saw folks with stadium or tailgating chairs. Just pop them out, sit and enjoy the view. \\nAfter checking out the view from the tower, there are multiple options for viewing the landscapes by hiking or driving. \\nKeep in mind that some trails have noticeable declines/inclines and uneven, cracked pavement, and these are not suitable for strollers or folks that have physical limitations.\\nOne way to get amazing views is to drive on Christopher Clark Road by turning left off of Reservation Road at the Visitor Center. There are four spots to safely pull off, and sometimes you’ll have the spot all to yourself.\\nAlso, you can head right from the Visitor Center on a paved trail up to Goat Peak where there is an overlook and a (second) Lookout Tower with great views of the town and surrounding landscape. Though the trail distance to Goat Peak is short, it is an uphill hike.\\nThere are so many parts of the reservation to explore with different trails and spots to see beautiful vistas, so [check out this trail map](https://www.mass.gov/doc/mt-tom-state-reservation-trail-map/download) to help plan your visit.\\nTip: If you like taking Komorebi (i.e., sun flare/light peeking through trees) pictures, Mt.

Simply follow the sign behind the visitor center to Bray Tower. This path is suitable for strollers and folks who may have some physical limitations. \\nThe lookout tower is three stories of stairs. It’s generally comfortable going up but coming down can seem a bit off-putting at first. You’ll have to let others come down the stairs first because they are not wide and wear your mask. \\nTip: There also are a few parking spots right near the Bray lookout tower if needed. \\nTip: There are benches by the base of the overlook to stop and take in the view. At many of the vistas, we saw folks with stadium or tailgating chairs. Just pop them out, sit and enjoy the view. \\nAfter checking out the view from the tower, there are multiple options for viewing the landscapes by hiking or driving. \\nKeep in mind that some trails have noticeable declines/inclines and uneven, cracked pavement, and these are not suitable for strollers or folks that have physical limitations.\\nOne way to get amazing views is to drive on Christopher Clark Road by turning left off of Reservation Road at the Visitor Center. There are four spots to safely pull off, and sometimes you’ll have the spot all to yourself.\\nAlso, you can head right from the Visitor Center on a paved trail up to Goat Peak where there is an overlook and a (second) Lookout Tower with great views of the town and surrounding landscape. Though the trail distance to Goat Peak is short, it is an uphill hike.\\nThere are so many parts of the reservation to explore with different trails and spots to see beautiful vistas, so [check out this trail map](https://www.mass.gov/doc/mt-to\n",

            "| One of the most popular seaside destinations in Naples, the mile-long stretch of white sugar sand at Delnor-Wiggins has been rated one of the best beaches in the nation. The 199-acre park is a tropical paradise for beach lovers, boaters and divers. The beach is a popular spot to sunbathe, swim, beachcomb, snorkel and picnic. At the beach along Wiggins Pass, where swimming is not allowed, fishing is a popular activity. Boaters can launch their vessels into Water Turkey Bay and travel to the Gulf or up the Cocohatchee River for both saltwater and freshwater fishing. Kayakers can enjoy paddling through estuaries and scuba divers can explore the hard bottom reef in the Gulf. At the north end of the island, a tower gives visitors a bird's-eye view of Wiggins Pass and the surrounding coastal habitat. **Delnor Wiggins Pass State Park - Overview** _Overview of Delnor Wiggins Pass State Park_ Separated by the mainland by mangrove swamps and tidal creeks, this recreation area is located on a narrow barrier island off Florida's southwest coast. A pass on the north end of the island is a natural outlet for the Cocohatchee River. The park offers Gulf-front swimming, fishing, picnicking and a boat ramp in a lush setting of sea oats, sea grapes, cabbage palms and mangroves. Delnor-Wiggins Pass State Park is located in North Naples six miles west of I-75, exit 111. Delnor Wiggins Pass State Park is one of the most popular Naples Florida Beaches in Southwest Florida. Occupying the north end of a barrier island, the pass serves as a natural outlet for the Cocohatchee River. The variety of vegetation at Delnor-Wiggins Pass creates a lush wildlife habitat, featuring sea oats, sea grapes and cabbage palms. The main feature in the park, however, is the mangrove forest. Occupying 80 percent of the park, the leaves of the mangroves provide a major source of nutrition for the marine animals that begin their life in the backwater before entering the Gulf. Mangroves also buffer the mainland against destructive storms, prevent erosion with their specialized root system and filter the water to maintain quality and clarity. The natural coastal area of Delnor-Wiggins provides habitat for a wide variety of wildlife. The most visible are the many species of shore and wading birds, small mammals and reptiles. The shallow Gulf waters are home for countless forms of marine life such as soft corals, mollusks, crustaceans and fish. Endangered loggerhead sea turtles come ashore on summer nights to lay their eggs. In the winter, the pass if often frequented by the endangered West Indian manatee seeking warm water. In the 1600's, the Calusa Indians thrived around the pass by gathering wild plants, fishing and hunting. During the 1800's the Seminole Indians and early European settlers found refuge in this semi-tropical area. Joe Wiggins, for whom the pass is named, operated a small trading post and is the first homesteader on record. Several generations later, through the foresight of Lester J. and Dellora A. Norris, the land was acquired as a park for Collier County in 1964. Six years later, the Division of Recreation and Parks purchased the land from the county for development of a state park. After completion of the development, Delnor-Wiggins Pass State Recreation Area was officially opened to the public in 1981. Years later the Division of Recreation and Parks renamed the recreation areas to state parks. **Delnor Wiggins Pass State Park - Activities** A variety of recreational activities are offered at Delnor-Wiggins Pass State Park. For convenient access to the beach, five parking lots with a system of connecting trails and boardwalks are available. Picnic tables, grills and bicycle racks are provided as well as bathhouses with changing stalls and out-door showers. A picnic pavilion, observation tower and boardwalk access to Wiggins Pass can be found at the very north end of the park. A boat ramp allows access to the back bays, Cocohatchee River and the Gulf of Mexico, providing visitors with excellent fishing opportunities. The most popular place to fish is Wiggins Pass. It is also the only area along the park's beach where fishing is allowed. Visitors who plan to fish should remember to dispose of monofilament fishing line properly as it can injure or kill animals in the park. Swimming and shelling are popular pastimes year-round. Because of dangerous currents and deep water, swimming is never allowed in the pass. In order to conserve shell resources for future generation, collecting of live shells, including starfish and sand dollars, is prohibited. For more information contact Delnor Wiggins Pass State Park at 239.597.6196. A pristine beach on the Gulf of Mexico, Delnor-Wiggins Pass State Park has some of the best shelling opportunities on the Gulf coast. Live shelling is prohibited. Two beach wheel chairs, one in area 1 and one in area 5 are available and free for use to the public. The boat ramp empties you into Water Turkey Bay, which runs via the South Channel into the Cocohatchee River. The docks at the boat ramp are ADA accessible. From the Cocohatchee River you can go north via the back bays up into Estero Bay, east up the Cocohatchee River or, as most visitors do, head west into the Gulf of Mexico through Wiggins Pass. Fishing covers a wide area around the park. You can fish from a vessel in the Gulf, Water Turkey Bay and the Cocohatchee River, except within 300 feet of the park beach along the Gulf of Mexico. This area is buoyed off for swimming. No vessels are permitted to anchor within 100 feet of the designated fishing area, which encompasses the pass. You may fish from the shoreline along Wiggins Pass or wade fish in Water Turkey Bay. Fishing is prohibited in the swimming areas of the park. An interpretive exhibit is located at the picnic pavilion. There is also a kiosk on shore birds on the beach near Wiggins Pass. Pets are allowed in this park, however, not on the beaches. They must be well-behaved and kept on a six-foot, hand-held leash at all times. Pets must not be left unattended, or taken into restroom facilities or concession areas. You must \"scoop\" after your pet. (Don't forget your baggies!) These rules help preserve an important habitat for wildlife. Please do not leave your pets unattended in a vehicle for their safety, as temperatures inside vehicles can be dangerously high. Service animals are welcome in all areas and buildings of the park, as required by law. The covered, open-air pavilion is located at the north end of parking area 5 in the Coastal Hammock. There is a grill nearby for your convenience. The pavilion accommodates up to 100 people and has 10 picnic tables. To reserve the picnic pavilion, call the park at (239) 597-6196. We have picnic areas located between each parking lot and the beach with boardwalks leading to them. They are located in a Coastal Hammock for shade. There are grills and tables available.

The 199-acre park is a tropical paradise for beach lovers, boaters and divers. The beach is a popular spot to sunbathe, swim, beachcomb, snorkel and picnic. At the beach along Wiggins Pass, where swimming is not allowed, fishing is a popular activity. Boaters can launch their vessels into Water Turkey Bay and travel to the Gulf or up the Cocohatchee River for both saltwater and freshwater fishing. Kayakers can enjoy paddling through estuaries and scuba divers can explore the hard bottom reef in the Gulf. At the north end of the island, a tower gives visitors a bird\\\\\\'s-eye view of Wiggins Pass and the surrounding coastal habitat. **Delnor Wiggins Pass State Park - Overview** _Overview of Delnor Wiggins Pass State Park_ Separated by the mainland by mangrove swamps and tidal creeks, this recreation area is located on a narrow barrier island off Florida\\\\\\'s southwest coast. A pass on the north end of the island is a natural outlet for the Cocohatchee River. The park offers Gulf-front swimming, fishing, picnicking and a boat ramp in a lush setting of sea oats, sea grapes, cabbage palms and mangroves. Delnor-Wiggins Pass State Park is located in North Naples six miles west of I-75, exit 111. Delnor Wiggins Pass State Park is one of the most popular Naples Florida Beaches in Southwest Florida. Occupying the north end of a barrier island, the pass serves as a natural outlet for the Cocohatchee River. The variety of vegetation at Delnor-Wiggins Pass creates a lush wildlife habitat, featuring sea oats, sea grapes and cabbage palms. The main feature in the park, however, is the mangrove forest. Occupying 80 percent of the park, the leaves of the mangroves provide a major source of nutrition for the marine animals that begin their life in the backwater before entering the Gulf. Mangroves also buffer the mainland against destructive storms, prevent erosion with their specialized root system and filter the water to maintain quality and clarity. The natural coastal area of Delnor-Wiggins provides habitat for a wide variety of wildlife. The most visible are the many species of shore and wading birds, small mammals and reptiles. The shallow Gulf waters are home for countless forms of marine life such as soft corals, mollusks, crustaceans and fish. Endangered loggerhead sea turtles come ashore on summer nights to lay their eggs. In the winter, the pass if often frequented by the endangered West Indian manatee seeking warm water. In the 1600\\\\\\'s, the Calusa Indians thrived around the pass by gathering wild plants, fishing and hunting. During the 1800\\\\\\'s the Seminole Indians and early European settlers found refuge in this semi-tropical area. Joe Wiggins, for whom the pass is named, operated a small trading post and is the first homesteader on record. Several generations later, through the foresight of Lester J. and Dellora A. Norris, the land was acquired as a park for Collier County in 1964. Six years later, the Division of Recreation and Parks purchased the land from the county for development of a state park. After completion of the development, Delnor-Wiggins Pass State Recreation Area was officially opened to the public in 1981. Years later the Division of Recreation and Parks renamed the recreation areas to state parks. **Delnor Wiggins Pass State Park - Activities** A variety of recreational activities are offered at Delnor-Wiggins Pass State Park. For convenient access to the beach, five parking lots with a system of connecting trails and boardwalks are available. Picnic tables, grills and bicycle racks are provided as well as bathhouses with changing stalls and out-door showers. A picnic pavilion, observation tower and boardwalk access to Wiggins Pass can be found at the very north end of the park. A boat ramp allows access to the back bays, Cocohatchee River and the Gulf of Mexico, providing visitors with excellent fishing opportunities. The most popular place to fish is Wiggins Pass. It is also the only area along the park\\\\\\'s beach where fishing is allowed. Visitors who plan to fish should remember to dispose of monofilament fishing line properly as it can injure or kill animals in the park. Swimming and shelling are popular pastimes year-round. Because of dangerous currents and deep water, swimming is never allowed in the pass. In order to conserve shell resources for future generation, collecting of live shells, including starfish and sand dollars, is prohibited. For more information contact Delnor Wiggins Pass State Park at 239.597.6196. A pristine beach on the Gulf of Mexico, Delnor-Wiggins Pass State Park has some of the best shelling opportunities on the Gulf coast. Live shelling is prohibited.

Fishing covers a wide area around the park. You can fish from a vessel in the Gulf, Water Turkey Bay and the Cocohatchee River, except within 300 feet of the park beach along the Gulf of Mexico. This area is buoyed off for swimming. No vessels are permitted to anchor within 100 feet of the designated fishing area, which encompasses the pass. You may fish from the shoreline along Wiggins Pass or wade fish in Water Turkey Bay. Fishing is prohibited in the swimming areas of the park.

The 199-acre park is a tropical paradise for beach lovers, boaters and divers. The beach is a popular spot to sunbathe, swim, beachcomb, snorkel and picnic. At the beach along Wiggins Pass, where swimming is not allowed, fishing is a popular activity. Boaters can launch their vessels into Water Turkey Bay and travel to the Gulf or up the Cocohatchee River for both saltwater and freshwater fishing. Kayakers can enjoy paddling through estuaries and scuba divers can explore the hard bottom reef in the Gulf. At the north end of the island, a tower gives visitors a bird\\'s-eye view of Wiggins Pass and the surrounding coastal habitat. **Delnor Wiggins Pass State Park - Overview** _Overview of Delnor Wiggins Pass State Park_ Separated by the mainland by mangrove swamps and tidal creeks, this recreation area is located on a narrow barrier island off Florida\\'s southwest coast. A pass on the north end of the island is a natural outlet for the Cocohatchee River. The park offers Gulf-front swimming, fishing, picnicking and a boat ramp in a lush setting of sea oats, sea grapes, cabbage palms and mangroves. Delnor-Wiggins Pass State Park is located in North Naples six miles west of I-75, exit 111. Delnor Wiggins Pass State Park is one of the most popular Naples Florida Beaches in Southwest Florida. Occupying the north end of a barrier island, the pass serves as a natural outlet for the Cocohatchee River. The variety of vegetation at Delnor-Wiggins Pass creates a lush wildlife habitat, featuring sea oats, sea grapes and cabbage palms. The main feature in the park, however, is the mangrove forest. Occupying 80 percent of the park, the leaves of the mangroves provide a major source of nutrition for the marine animals that begin their life in the backwater before entering the Gulf. Mangroves also buffer the mainland against destructive storms, prevent erosion with their specialized root system and filter the water to maintain quality and clarity. The natural coastal area of Delnor-Wiggins provides habitat for a wide variety of wildlife. The most visible are the many species of shore and wading birds, small mammals and reptiles. The shallow Gulf waters are home for countless forms of marine life such as soft corals, mollusks, crustaceans and fish. Endangered loggerhead sea turtles come ashore on summer nights to lay their eggs. In the winter, the pass if often frequented by the endangered West Indian manatee seeking warm water. In the 1600\\'s, the Calusa Indians thrived around the pass by gathering wild plants, fishing and hunting. During the 1800\\'s the Seminole Indians and early European settlers found refuge in this semi-tropical area. Joe Wiggins, for whom the pass is named, operated a small trading post and is the first homesteader on record. Several generations later, through the foresight of Lester J. and Dellora A. Norris, the land was acquired as a park for Collier County in 1964. Six years later, the Division of Recreation and Parks purchased the land from the county for development of a state park. After completion of the development, Delnor-Wiggins Pass State Recreation Area was officially opened to the public in 1981. Years later the Division of Recreation and Parks renamed the recreation areas to state parks. **Delnor Wiggins Pass State Park - Activities** A variety of recreational activities are offered at Delnor-Wiggins Pass State Park. For convenient access to the beach, five parking lots with a system of connecting trails and boardwalks are available. Picnic tables, grills and bicycle racks are provided as well as bathhouses with changing stalls and out-door showers. A picnic pavilion, observation tower and boardwalk access to Wiggins Pass can be found at the very north end of the park. A boat ramp allows access to the back bays, Cocohatchee River and the Gulf of Mexico, providing visitors with excellent fishing opportunities. The most popular place to fish is Wiggins Pass. It is also the only area along the park\\'s beach where fishing is allowed. Visitors who plan to fish should remember to dispose of monofilament fishing line properly as it can injure or kill animals in the park. Swimming and shelling are popular pastimes year-round. Because of dangerous currents and deep water, swimming is never allowed in the pass. In order to conserve shell resources for future generation, collecting of live shells, including starfish and sand dollars, is prohibited. For more information contact Delnor Wiggins Pass State Park at 239.597.6196. A pristine beach on the Gulf of Mexico, Delnor-Wiggins Pass State Park has some of the best shelling opportunities on the Gulf coast. Live shelling is prohibited. Two beach wheel chairs, one in area 1 and one in area 5 are available and free for use to the public. The boat ramp empties you into Water Turkey Bay, which runs via the South Channel into the Cocohatchee River. The docks at the boat ramp are ADA accessible. From the Cocohatchee River you can go north via the back bays up into Estero Bay, east up the Cocohatchee River or, as most visitors do, head west into the Gulf of Mexico through Wiggins Pass. Fishing covers a wide area around the park. You can fish from a vessel in the Gulf, Water Turkey Bay and the Cocohatchee River, except within 300 feet of the park beach along the Gulf of Mexico. This area is buoyed off for swimming. No vessels are permitted to anchor within 100 feet of the designated fishing area, which encompasses the pass. You may fish from the shoreline along Wiggins Pass or wade fish in Water Turkey Bay. Fishing is prohibited in the swimming areas of the park. An interpretive exhibit is located at the picnic pavilion. There is also a kiosk on shore birds on the beach near Wiggins Pass. Pets are allowed in this park, however, not on the beaches. They must be well-behaved and kept on a six-foot, hand-held leash at all times. Pets must not be left unattended, or taken into restroom facilities or concession areas. You must \"scoop\" after your pet. (Don\\'t forget your baggies!) These rules help preserve an important habitat for wildlife. Please do not leave your pets unattended in a vehicle for their safety, as temperatures inside vehicles can be dangerously high. Service animals are welcome in all areas and buildings of the park, as required by law. The covered, open-air pavilion is located at the north end of parking area 5 in the Coastal Hammock. There is a grill nearby for your convenience. The pavilion accommodates up to 100 people and has 10 picnic tables. To reserve the picnic pavilion, call the park at (239) 597-6196. We have picnic areas located between each parking lot and the beach with boardwalks leading to them. They are located in a Coastal Hammock for shade. There are grills and tables available. Delnor-Wiggins Pass State Park has six (6) restroom facilities. All are ADA accessible. There is a hard bottom reef, which runs parallel to the beach where scuba diving is permitted. The closest area to the reef is area 2. Fresh water rinse showers are available at the park. Snorkeling is permitted along the beach.

Norris, the land was acquired as a park for Collier County in 1964. Six years later, the Division of Recreation and Parks purchased the land from the county for development of a state park.

            "ter the Division of Recreation and Parks renamed the recreation areas to state parks. **Delnor Wiggins Pass State Park - Activities** A variety of recreational activities are offered at Delnor-Wiggins Pass State Park. For convenient access to the beach, five parking lots with a system of connecting trails and boardwalks are available. Picnic tables, grills and bicycle racks are provided as well as bathhouses with changing stalls and out-door showers. A picnic pavilion, observation tower and boardwalk access to Wiggins Pass can be found at the very north end of the park. A boat ramp allows access to the back bays, Cocohatchee River and the Gulf of Mexico, providing visitors with excellent fishing opportunities. The most popular place to fish is Wiggins Pass. It is also the only area along the park\\'s beach where fishing is allowed. Visitors who plan to fish should remember to dispose of monofilament fishing line properly as it can injure or kill animals in the park. Swimming and shelling are popular pastimes year-round. Because of dangerous currents and deep water, swimming is never allowed in the pass. In order to conserve shell resources for future generation, collecting of live shells, including starfish and sand dollars, is prohibited. For more information contact Delnor Wiggins Pass State Park at 239.597.6196. A pristine beach on the Gulf of Mexico, Delnor-Wiggins Pass State Park has some of the best shelling opportunities on the Gulf coast. Live shelling is prohibited. Two beach wheel chairs, one in area 1 and one in area 5 are available and free for use to the public. The boat ramp empties you into Water Turkey Bay, which runs via the South Channel into the Cocohatchee River. The docks at the boat ramp are ADA accessible. From the Cocohatchee River you can go north via the back bays up into Estero Bay, east up the Cocohatchee River or, as most visitors do, head west into the Gulf of Mexico through Wiggins Pass. Fishing covers a wide area around the park. You can fish from a vessel in the Gulf, Water Turkey Bay and the Cocohatchee River, except within 300 feet of the park beach along the Gulf of Mexico. This area is buoyed off for swimming. No vessels are permitted to anchor within 100 feet of the designated fishing area, which encompasses the pass. You may fish from the shoreline along Wiggins Pass or wade fish in Water Turkey Bay. Fishing is prohibited in the swimming areas of the park. An interpretive exhibit is located at the picnic pavilion. There is also a kiosk on shore birds on the beach near Wiggins Pass. Pets are allowed in this park, however, not on the beaches. They must be well-behaved and kept on a six-foot, hand-held leash at all times. Pets must not be left unattended, or taken into restroom facilities or concession areas. You must \"scoop\" after your pet. (Don\\'t forget your baggies!) These rules help preserve an important habitat for wildlife. Please do not leave your pets unattended in a vehicle for their safety, as tempera\n",

            "A large bone attached to a tree, with the words “Canine Cove,” welcomes you to one of the best dog parks in . There’s plenty of ground to cover for your adventurous and excited pup, so let’s get to it.\n",
            "Canine Cove is a quaint and clean dog park located within the [Frank E. Mackle Community Park](https://www.escapetomarco.com/marco-island-parks/). You can find a really rewarding path along the park lake as well as facilities, playground area for the kids, shuffleboard, basketball, and more. \n",
            "Canine Cove is the most dog-friendly part of Mackle Park, and the area you will likely spend the most time if you brought your fuzzy family friend along for the adventure.\n",
            "Dogs are allowed on a leash outside the borders of Canine Cove at the park. Please follow proper etiquette for waste removal, behavior, and interaction with other pets and people. Though dogs are allowed on a leash within the park grounds, they are still not allowed in tennis courts, the playgrounds, and athletic fields. \n",
            "Of course, [Canine Cove on Marco Island](https://www.escapetomarco.com/what-to-do-with-your-pet-on-marco-island-take-your-dog-on-a-canine-cove-vacation/) is the best place to be with your pet. Let your pup frolic leash-free and enjoy one of the prized gems of the island. \n",
            "The park area is split into two. There is an area for small dogs and an area for big dogs. The small dog area is recommended for 25 pounds and under. Dogs are expected to be well-behaved, and the community follows a self-policing approach to making sure owners and their pets are playing along.\n",
            "Because this is Florida, the cove offers plenty of shade, with big trees, a water station, and some picnic seats for you to sit on. \n",
            "## Inside Canine Cove- Rules and Things to Know\n",
            "The Canine Cove dog park on Marco Island is a wonderful spot for your dogs to let loose, something they can’t always easily do while adventuring about in the Florida gulf coast. Fortunately, the cove is just the place, especially when everyone is following the basic guidelines. Children under four are not admitted into the gated dog area for safety reasons. No food is permitted in the cove as well, also for safety reasons. Any pup owner knows how dogs can get around a worthwhile treat.\n",
            "It is also strongly suggested that owners have a collar as well as a current ID and license tag. The park does have a closed gate area so you can leash up and prepare before opening the gate to the park.\n",
            "hours are 8 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. every day, including weekends. The park is officially located at 1361 Andalusia Terrace on Marco Island. This will bring you to the Frank E. Mackle Park, but walk southwest and you won’t miss the dog park near the edge of the community lake. For more Canine Cove information, contact us or local Collier County.\n",
            "There are no other major off-leash dog parks in Marco Island, but you can find some outside the island. This includes Lovers Key. Many visitors ask about the top island beach site- is Tigertail Beach dog-friendly? No dogs are allowed on in either Naples or Collier County, including Tigertail, but many local restaurants will welcome your pups.\n",

There’s plenty of ground to cover for your adventurous and excited pup, so let’s get to it.\\nCanine Cove is a quaint and clean dog park located within the [Frank E. Mackle Community Park](https://www.escapetomarco.com/marco-island-parks/). You can find a really rewarding path along the park lake as well as facilities, playground area for the kids, shuffleboard, basketball, and more. \\nCanine Cove is the most dog-friendly part of Mackle Park, and the area you will likely spend the most time if you brought your fuzzy family friend along for the adventure.\\nDogs are allowed on a leash outside the borders of Canine Cove at the park. Please follow proper etiquette for waste removal, behavior, and interaction with other pets and people. Though dogs are allowed on a leash within the park grounds, they are still not allowed in tennis courts, the playgrounds, and athletic fields. \\nOf course, [Canine Cove on Marco Island](https://www.escapetomarco.com/what-to-do-with-your-pet-on-marco-island-take-your-dog-on-a-canine-cove-vacation/) is the best place to be with your pet. Let your pup frolic leash-free and enjoy one of the prized gems of the island. \\nThe park area is split into two. There is an area for small dogs and an area for big dogs. The small dog area is recommended for 25 pounds and under. Dogs are expected to be well-behaved, and the community follows a self-policing approach to making sure owners and their pets are playing along.\\nBecause this is Florida, the cove offers plenty of shade, with big trees, a water station, and some picnic seats for you to sit on. \\n## Inside Canine Cove- Rules and Things to Know\\nThe Canine Cove dog park on Marco Island is a wonderful spot for your dogs to let loose, something they can’t always easily do while adventuring about in the Florida gulf coast. Fortunately, the cove is just the place, especially when everyone is following the basic guidelines. Children under four are not admitted into the gated dog area for safety reasons. No food is permitted in the cove as well, also for safety reasons. Any pup owner knows how dogs can get around a worthwhile treat.\\nIt is also strongly suggested that owners have a collar as well as a current ID and license tag. The park does have a closed gate area so you can leash up and prepare before opening the gate to the park.\\nhours are 8 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. every day, including weekends. The park is officially located at 1361 Andalusia Terrace on Marco Island. This will bring you to the Frank E. Mackle Park, but walk southwest and you won’t miss the dog park near the edge of the community lake. For more Canine Cove information, contact us or local Collier County.\\nThere are no other major off-leash dog parks in Marco Island, but you can find some outside the island. This includes Lovers Key. Many visitors ask about the top island beach site- is Tigertail Beach dog-friendly?

The fee remains lower than many neighboring beach access areas that charge by the hour.

Thank you for supporting our parks and preserves!\\nWhether you are sitting on the beach or kayaking near the still water’s edge at Fort De Soto, you find yourself absorbed in the abundance of natural beauty as far as the eye can see. The complexity of the ecology is not immediately apparent, but the park offers the greatest diversity of systems just about anywhere. Emerging from the wealth of bird life, sea life, wildlife and plant life is the majestic tapestry called Fort De Soto.\\nThe largest park within the Pinellas County Park System, Fort De Soto park consists of 1,136 acres made up of five interconnected islands (keys). These keys are home to beach plants, mangroves, wetlands, palm hammocks, hardwoods and scores of native plants. Each of these species plays a vital role in the preservation and protection of the natural environment.\\nAnother amazing example of the importance of the park’s natural ecosystems is the more than 328 that ornithologists have documents over a 60-year span.

Dogs are welcome to join you on trails.\n",
            "Originally called Round Top Park, Sibley shares with Temescal and Tilden the distinction of being one of the East Bay Regional Park District’s original parks. The preserve was later named in honor of Robert Sibley, who helped found the District and served for 10 years on its board of directors.\n",
            "Round Top, one of the area’s highest peaks, is made up of lava and volcanic debris left over from a 10-million-year-old volcano. During the past 10 million years, massive tectonic forces on the Hayward and Moraga earthquake faults uplifted the Berkeley hills, folding bedrock formations and tilting the Round Top volcano complex on its side.\n",
            "Softer sedimentary rock from the Orinda Formation eroded away, exposing the Round Top volcano. In addition, quarrying in the north half of the preserve has revealed cross sections of the bedrock geology, providing an unsurpassed outdoor laboratory for studying volcanism in the Central Coast Ranges.\n",
            "Several trails provide access throughout the preserve. The 31-mile East Bay Skyline National Recreation Trail, part of the Bay Area Ridge Trail system, traverses the preserve along the ridgeline between Wildcat Canyon and Anthony Chabot Parks.\n",
            "Round Top Road goes from the Sibley visitor center to the top of Round Top.\n",
            "Round Top Loop Trail circles Round Top peak.\n",
            "Volcanic Trail, once a quarry haul road, contains most of the stops on the self-guided volcanic tour.\n",
            "From Old Tunnel Road on the northwest side of the park, the paved Quarry Road ascends and meets the east end of Volcanic Trail. Quarry Trail connects the middle of Volcanic Trail to a point lower down on Quarry Road. Finally, Pond Trail is a short trail segment that descends to a couple of ponds on the north side of the preserve.\n",
            "Most trails are hiking and equestrian only. A few trails are multi-use. Dogs are permitted at Sibley, but are not allowed on adjacent Huckleberry trails. A visitor center at the park shelves self-guided tour brochures so guests can stroll the park and learn of its historic significance at their own leisure.\n",
