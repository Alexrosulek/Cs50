Hike the trails or cool off in the spring-fed pool. Walk along the wooded river valley, climb the Dakota Valley Trail to the lookout for great fall colors, or go canoeing on Brawner Lake. Woodlands, maples, basswoods, oaks, and cottonwoods, dominate this park. Sun-drenched prairies, grasslands, and marshes offer added diversity. The park provides picnic areas, campgrounds (drive-in, horseback, and group), swimming, hiking, and cross-country skiing.\n",

            "Come marvel at this day-use (no camping available) park’s remarkable features. Located just outside of Great Falls and encompassing nearly 14 miles of Missouri River shoreline, Giant Springs State Park has something for everyone. The park provides opportunities for hiking, biking, picnicking, photography, fishing, hunting, boating, and bird watching. Experience the Giant Springs, which is one of the largest freshwater springs in the county, producing over 156 million gallons of water each day. Listen to the tranquil sounds of the water cascading into the Roe River, once listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world’s shortest river. Visit the Giant Springs Fish Hatchery and take a walk through the visitor center or feed the fish in the show pond. Find a place to picnic among the towering silver poplars, mature blue spruce or on the manicured lawn. Bring your binoculars or camera and enjoy the park’s exceptional birding opportunities.\n",
            "If you are looking for something a little more active, Giant Springs provides excellent fishing opportunities along the Missouri River as well as a separate fishing pond. Take a walk, go for a run or ride your bike along the park’s 30+ miles of paved and dirt single-track trails, which range in difficulty from beginner to expert. The trails are all part of the larger System, which consists of nearly 60 miles of trail around the Great Falls area. Take a walk or drive to the four Missouri River waterfalls (five, if you count the now buried Colter Falls) that are all located within the park. Giant Springs is rich with history that includes the Lewis and Clark Expedition, silver smelting and Paris Gibson, the founder of Great Falls.\n",

            "Giant Springs State Park was discovered by the Lewis & Clark Expedition in 1805 and is one of the largest freshwater springs in the county. The spring flows at a rate of 156 million gallons of crystal clear water from the Madison Aquifer per day, the water originates from the Little Belt Mountains and takes approximately 26 years to reach the springs. Amazingly the water is a constant 54 degrees year round, during the cold winter months water vapor covers the air and soaks the trees in the park, which then forms beautiful ice covered trees shining in the sunlight.\n",
            "Once you visit this magnificent State Park you will realize why it is the most visited State Park in Montana, with over 300,000 visits a year. The springs is amazing to witness and view, but there are over 4,500 acres of front and back county to visit as well. The Park encompasses land on the North and South shores of the “Might Mo” (Missouri River). We have over 20 miles of amazing single track trail to bike, hike and enjoy plus miles of paved trail for the casual bike/walk/birding adventure. The park also has one of the most amazing features of Montana, the “Great Falls”. The Great Falls of the Missouri is one of 4 waterfalls within the Park and we also have 5 hydroelectric dams owned by Northwestern Energy. All of the waterfalls and most of the dams are viewable by road and overlooks throughout the Park. The overlooks contain informational kiosks, vault toilets and access to the trails.\n",
            "The Park also contains Giant Springs State Fish Hatchery; Giant Springs State Park is the only State Park with a fish hatchery located within its boundaries. The Hatchery uses water from the springs to fill their raceways. Stop in and learn about the hatchery raised fish and view the monster trout in the show pond and you can even feed them.\n",
            "Recreation opportunities are endless within the park, you can: fish, hunt, hike, bike, bird watch or just have a relaxing picnic under the trees. The fishing is phenomenal from Roe Island; you have the springs bubbling out into the Missouri on one side and the springs running down the Roe River on the other side. The Roe River was once named the world’s shortest river by Guinness Book of World Records. If river fishing is not for you, there is the Family Fishing Pond with 5 docks for easy access and great fishing. If you are a hunter, there are acres of land that you can access, thanks to a conservation easement from Northwestern Energy. There is the opportunity to hunt; waterfowl, upland game birds and deer. If you just like to get out for some peace and quiet, take a stroll down one of the miles of paved or dirt trails, beautiful views of the Missouri around every corner.\n",
            "Giant Springs State Park has something for everybody! Stop in today to explore the park and all that is has to offer. We even have reservable group use areas, if you looking to have a wedding, family gathering, birthday party or any type of get together contact us for more information. Hope to see you soon at one of Montana’s gems.\n",
